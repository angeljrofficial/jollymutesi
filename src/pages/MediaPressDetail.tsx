        <p>From the moment she stepped onto the stage, Jolly captivated the audience with her poise and eloquence. But it was her vision for change that truly set her apart from other contestants.</p>

        <h3>A Vision Beyond Beauty</h3>

          <li>Youth empowerment through education</li>
          <li>Community development initiatives</li>
          <li>Breaking stereotypes about women in leadership</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Impact Journey Begins</h3>

        <p>Since her crowning, Jolly has been actively involved in various community projects, including nutrition programs, educational workshops, and leadership seminars for young women across Rwanda.</p>

        <p>"Every young person deserves the opportunity to dream big and work towards those dreams," she says. "My role is to show them that with determination and the right support, anything is possible."</p>
